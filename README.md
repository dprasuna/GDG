<img src="https://firebase.google.com/downloads/brand-guidelines/SVG/logo-built_white.svg" width="90"> <img src="https://github.com/favicon.ico" width="40">

The commitment of this repository is to allow all the Developer Student Clubs to **generate a site** for their club in **less than 3 minutes**, performing a few simple steps.<br> <br>
**The management of this site does not require any kind of web development and backend competence.**

## Demo
You can see the [demo here](https://andreabac3.github.io/dsc-website-template/)
## How can I change the content of the site without knowing web languages?

To change the content of the site, go to the `content` folder located in the root of the project. In this folder there are several .yaml files in which you can modify the contents. 

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To install you first need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your machine.
You need to perform the following steps only the first time.
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/andreabac3/dsc-website-template.git
cd dsc-website-template/

# Install the gatbsy CLI
npm i -g gatsby-cli

# Install local dependencies
npm install

# Run on localhost:8000 (by default)
# and edit the /content folder
npm run develop
```

**that's it!**

# Deploy
## Deploy on Firebase Hosting ðŸ”¥

We suggest to read the [Firebase Hosting guide reference from Gatsby website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-to-firebase/)

Make sure you have:

- a Firebase Account
- created a Firebase Project
<details><summary>Click here to read more about Firebase Deploy</summary>
<p>

> You can skip the first two points of the guide if you have already installed and configured the following dependencies.

<br>

1. Install the Firebase CLI with npm by running the following command and sign into firebase account:

```sh
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. Sign into Firebase using your Google account by running the following command:

```sh
firebase login
```

3. Navigate into the root of the project and running the following command:

```sh
firebase init
```

then select **Firebase Hosting** and the firebase project you wish to use or creat a new one if you haven't done it previously.

These first three steps are needed only once during the first configuration. After that, only step 4 is needed to deploy on Firebase.

4. Finally we can deploy our website

```sh
npm run deployFirebase
```

All done! Once the deployment concludes, you can access your website using `firebaseProjectId.firebaseapp.com` or `firebaseProjectId.web.app`.

N.B: of course replace the keyword <firebaseProjectId> with the name of your project.
